# echo
Escape the Dungeon Game (my first project)

THE GAME
echo is my first game that I've created using only Javascript and HTML. You move the character with the arrow keys
and the goal is to collect all keys while avoiding the ghosts in order to escape. Once all keys are collected, the
player thencan escape through the exit in the northeast corner.

CURRENT ISSUES
Since the character is bounded by movement of hard-coded coordinates, it is easy for him to get stuck in walls. 
When he gets stuck in walls, he moves in the opposite direction that is directed, this is because the bouncing effect
is taking place on each movement since he is outside bounds of the walls.
